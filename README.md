# GeneView App

•	Developed "GeneView," an interactive Shiny web application for analyzing Affy microarray breast cancer gene expression (ESR1, ERBB2, PTEN, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM) from the VDX datasets, utilizing Tidyverse and ggplot2 for visualizations and statistical analysis of 22,283 features across 344 samples from Bioconductor.

•	Integrated Shapiro-Wilk, Student’s t-test, and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests to assess gene expression patterns based on estrogen receptor (ER) status

•	Designed a dynamic UI with downloadable results, enabling users to upload custom gene lists, customize visualizations, and access zipped output files containing processed data and statistical summaries.
